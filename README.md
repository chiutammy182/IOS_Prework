# Prework - Surprise Color

Submitted by: Tammy Chiu

Surprise Color is an app that has basic information about me such as my name, where I go to college, and my future career. There is also a button that will change the background color when clicked.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- Users will see a screen with three labels and a button
- Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Apps I like:
1. Instagram:
   - Can like posts
   - Can edit sent messages
2. WhatsApp:
   - Can add reactions to a message from someone
   - Can change the background for conversations with different people
3. Youtube:
   - Get notifications when you have a creators bell toggled
   - Able to post comments on a video as well as like/dislike comments
4. Slack:
   - Can set your status such as active, away, vacationing, lunch, in a meeting
   - Can send yourself messages/acts as a notepad for taking down notes
     
An app that I would like to create would be a study app where students can use it for staying up to date with all of their activities. For instance, it will have a calendar where the user can add events on certain days and times. The app will notifiy the user when the event is upcoming. Additionally, the app can be used as a timer for studying. For instance, when a user sets up a timer, they can specify how long they want to study for in total and when they want to be alerted for intervals of breaks. So if a user selects to study for 3 hours and breaks every half an hour for 5 minutes then the app will have an alert/notifcation every half an hour for a 5 minute break. Another feature in the app I would like to implement is a section where the user can jot down notes/ideas to oneself.

## Notes
 A challenge I faced was adding and pushing my changes to GitHub using GitHub Desktop. I had some trouble adding the project files to the created repo but some videos online helped me figure this out.
